(Work in progress!)

Eventually, this may be a simple linux game using two separate physical keyboards

Currently this is very simple and reads directly from the Linux event queues. Example code was discovered and noted in the source code
and will be updated in this readme.

The idea is that each player has a separate keyboard and interacts with some scrolling text on the screen.
